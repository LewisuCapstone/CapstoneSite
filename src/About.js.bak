			The creation of Community Charities was motivated by the desire to make it easier for local charitable organizations, businesses, and individuals to come together and make a positive impact in their communities. We believe that by providing a centralized platform for charitable activities, we can help to remove some of the barriers that can prevent effective collaboration and resource sharing.
			<br/><br/>
			We were inspired by the many amazing charitable organizations and individuals seen doing incredible work in their communities but also saw the challenges they face in terms of resource management, volunteer coordination, and event promotion. We saw an opportunity to leverage technology to create a more efficient and effective way for these organizations and individuals to connect and work together towards common goals.
			<br/><br/>
			We also believe that by making it easier for individuals to donate to local causes, we can help to promote greater community engagement and philanthropy. By providing a marketplace for charitable donations, we hope to make it simple and easy for individuals to support causes they care about and see the impact of their contributions in real time.
			<br/><br/>
			Overall, our motivation for creating Community Charities is rooted in a deep belief in the power of community and the ability of individuals and organizations to come together to make a difference. We hope that our platform can play a meaningful role in helping to facilitate this kind of collaboration and support the incredible work being done by local charitable organizations, businesses, and individuals.
